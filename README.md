# Business Case Study: Audiobook app

You are given data from an Audiobook app. Logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books. We want to create a machine learning model based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.

- The data is from an audiobook app, each customer in the database has make a purchase at least once.
- The main idea is that the company shouldn't spend there money targeting individuals who are unlikely to come back.
- If we focus on client who are more likely to convert again we'll get increase the sales and profitability figures.

The model must show us which are the most important metrics for a client to come back.
